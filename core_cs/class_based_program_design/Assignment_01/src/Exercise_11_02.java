/*
Exercise 11.2 Exercise 3.2 provides the data definition for a weather recording program. Design the following methods for the WeatherRecord class:
1. withinRange, which determines whether todayâ€™s high and low were
within the normal range;
2. rainyDay, which determines whether the precipitation is higher than
some given value;
3. recordDay, which determines whether the temperature broke either
the high or the low record.
