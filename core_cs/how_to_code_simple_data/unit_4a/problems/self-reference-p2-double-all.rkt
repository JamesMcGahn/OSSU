; Remember the data definition for a list of numbers we designed in Lecture 5f:
; (if this data definition does not look familiar, please review the lecture)

;; ListOfNumber is one of:

; 
; Design a function that consumes a list of numbers and doubles every number 
; in the list. Call it double-all.
